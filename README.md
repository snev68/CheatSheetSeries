# Welcome to OWASP Cheat Sheet Series V2

This repository will contains all the cheat sheets of the project and will represent the V2 of the [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Cheat_Sheet_Series) project.

# Migration process

A mass conversion from Mediawiki to GitHub flavored Markdown format has been performed using this [tool](https://github.com/philipashlock/mediawiki-to-markdown) based on [PANDOC](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) on **26th of december 2018** on all OWASP wiki pages flagged as [Cheatsheets](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Cheatsheets).

:warning: **Cheat Sheets content is now frozen from this date**:
* No modification will be performed anymore on the wiki content.
* Any modification will be made on this repository using the contribution issue template defined in this document/repository.

# Folders

**cheatsheets_to_convert**: 
* Contains the cheat sheets markdown files converted with PANDOC and for which a convertion work is needed in order to be cleanly converted to Github markdown.

**cheatsheets_excluded**:
* Contains the cheat sheets markdown files converted with PANDOC and for which a discution must be made in order to decide if we include them into the V2 of the project due to the content has not been updated since a long time or is not relevant anymore.

**cheatsheets**: 
* Contains the final cheat sheets files. 
* Any `.md` file present at the root of this folder is considered as `converted` and the associated cheat sheet is considered released.

**assets**: 
* Contains the assets used by the cheat sheets (images, pdf, zip...).
    * Naming convention is `[CHEAT_CHEET_MARKDOWN_FILE_NAME]_[IDENTIFIER].[EXTENSION]`
    * Use `PNG` format for the images.

**scripts**:
* Contains all the utility scripts used to operate the project (linter audit...).    

**templates**:
* Contains templates used for different kinds of files (cheatsheet...).

**.github**:
* Contains materials used to configure different behaviors of GitHub.

# Conversion rules

* Use the markdown syntax described in this [guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
* Use this [sheet](https://gist.github.com/molomby/9bc092e4a125f529ae362de7e46e8176) for Superscript and Subscript characters.
* Store all assets in the **assets** folder and use the following syntax:
    * `![ALTERNATE_NAME](../assets/ASSET_NAME.png)` for the insertion of an image.
    * `[ALTERNATE_NAME](../assets/ASSET_NAME.EXT)` for the insertion of other kinds of media (pdf, zip...).
* Use ATX style (`#` syntax) for section head. 
* Use `**bold**` syntax for **bold** text.
* Use `*italic*` syntax for *italic* text.
* Use `TAB` for nested lists and not spaces.
* Use [code fencing syntax along syntax highlighting](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/) for code snippet (prevent when possible horizontal scrollbar).
* No HTML code is allowed, only markdown syntax is allowed!
* Use this [site](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) for generation of tables.
* Use a single new line between a section head and the begining of its content.

# Editor & validation policy

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is used for the work on the markdown files. 

The file **Project.code-workspace** is the workspace file in order to open the project in VSCode.

The following [plugin](https://github.com/DavidAnson/vscode-markdownlint) is used to validate the markdown content.

The file **.markdownlint.json** define the central validation policy applied at VSCode (IDE) and TravisCI (CI) levels.

Details about rules is [here](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/master/doc/Rules.md).

The file **.markdownlinkcheck.json** define the configuration used to validate using this [tool](https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check), at TravisCI level, all HTTP, HTTPS and relatives links used in cheat sheets.
