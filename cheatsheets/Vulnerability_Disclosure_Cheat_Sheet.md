# Reporting Vulnerabilities

This section is intended to provide guidance for security researchers on how to report vulnerabilities to organisations

# Receiving Vulnerability Reports

This section is intended to provide guidance for organisations on how to accept and receive vulnerability reports

## Publishing Contact Details

- Make it easy for researchers to contact you
  + Contact us page
  + Common email addresses (security@)
  + Security.txt
  + Known vulnerability reporting/disclosure sites
- Provide PGP keys

## Bug Bounty Programs

- Provide financial rewards for researchers
- Must clearly define:
  + Scope
  + Types of vulnerabilities that are included
  + Reward levels
- Help mediate between researchers and organisations
- **Not a replacement for penetration testing or assurance activities**

## Communicating With Researchers

- Use PGP or other encrypted mechanisms
- Acknowledge initial receipt
- Provide updates to researcher
- Respond in a reasonable timeframe
- **Do not threaten lawsuits**

### Researchers Demanding Payment

- Some researchers will demand payment before revealing details
  + Usually a scam
  + Encourage use of a mediated platform for disclosure

## Triage

- Confirm whether vulnerability is real
- Obtain extra details where required
- Search for other instances of the vulnerability across the systems or codebase
- Identify the root cause of the vulnerability
- Consider outsourcing the initial triage to a third party (such as HackerOne)

## Fixing the Issue

- Implement and test fixes internally
- Request researcher confirms whether fix is effective
  + Share sufficient details with them

##  Disclosure

### Products and Open Source Software

- Request CVE if applicable
- Publish security advisory with details of affected versions
  + Credit the researcher
- Have a security-focused changelog on site
- Have a security-focused mailing list or announcements
- Publish sufficient details to help defenders

### Private Systems

- Credit the researcher
