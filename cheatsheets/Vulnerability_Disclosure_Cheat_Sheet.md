# Introduction

- CS is intended to provide guidance for both researchers and organisations on both side
- Collaboration between both sides is very important

**FIXME**

# Reporting Vulnerabilities

This section is intended to provide guidance for security researchers on how to report vulnerabilities to organisations

## Things Not To Do

- Submitting unverified scan results
- Reporting junk issues as high
- Making unreasonable demands (especially about the timeline)
- Demanding payments
- Being a dick

## Warnings and Legality

- Follow rules of bug bounty program if one exists
- Be aware of the laws in your country
- Demanding payment __may__ constitute blackmail
- Bug bounties are usually considered taxable income
  + Reporting and managing this is **your responsibility**
- Consider anonymous disclosure

## Finding Contact Details

- See the Publishing Contact Details section below
- Try other methods of communication:
  + Generic contact addresses
  + Phone
  + Social media (with care)
  + CERTs or other similar organisations

## Initial Report

- Try to send to security contact, not just generic address
- Encrypt where possible
- Include
  + Details of vulnerability
  + Steps to reproduce
  + Proof of concept
  + Impact (if known)
  + Recommendations on fixing the issue (optional)
- Explain disclosure process and timeline

## Ongoing Communication

- Maintain communication with vendor
- Provide further details if asked
- Retesting of suggested fixes
- Chase vendor and request updates when unresponsive

## When to Give Up

- Not all vendors are interested
  + Some are impossible to contact
  + Some don't care
  + Some are hostile and threaten legal action
- Known when to cut your losses and move on
- Don't get burned out over a specific issue
- Don't take it personally
- Don't risk your career and livelihood
- Focus your time and effort on companies who care
- Consider very carefully before going down the full disclosure route

## Publishing

- Discuss with vendor before publishing
- Consider rules of any bug bounty program and applicable laws
- May result in legal threats or action from hostile vendors

# Receiving Vulnerability Reports

This section is intended to provide guidance for organisations on how to accept and receive vulnerability reports

## Things Not To Do

- Threatening researchers
- Being impossible to contact
- Ignoring reports
- Pretending vulnerabilities don't exist or are trivial
- Being a dick

## Publishing Contact Details

- Make it easy for researchers to contact you
  + Contact us page
  + Common email addresses (security@)
  + Security.txt
  + Known vulnerability reporting/disclosure sites
- Provide PGP keys

## Bug Bounty Programs

- Provide financial rewards for researchers
- Must clearly define:
  + Scope
  + Types of vulnerabilities that are included
  + Reward levels
- Help mediate between researchers and organisations
- **Not a replacement for penetration testing or assurance activities**

## Communicating With Researchers

- Use PGP or other encrypted mechanisms
- Acknowledge initial receipt
- Provide updates to researcher
- Respond in a reasonable timeframe

### Researchers Demanding Payment

- Some researchers will demand payment before revealing details
  + Usually a scam
  + Encourage use of a mediated platform for disclosure

## Triage

- Confirm whether vulnerability is real
- Obtain extra details where required
- Search for other instances of the vulnerability across the systems or codebase
- Identify the root cause of the vulnerability
- Consider outsourcing the initial triage to a third party (such as HackerOne)

## Fixing the Issue

- Implement and test fixes internally
- Request researcher confirms whether fix is effective
  + Share sufficient details with them

##  Disclosure

### Products and Open Source Software

- Request CVE if applicable
- Publish security advisory with details of affected versions
  + Credit the researcher
- Have a security-focused changelog on site
- Have a security-focused mailing list or announcements
- Publish sufficient details to help defenders

### Private Systems

- Credit the researcher

# Methods of Disclosure

## Private Disclosure

- Vulnerability privately disclosed to vendor
- Only published with vendor's explicit approval
- Required by most bug bounty programs
- Generally appropriate for private systems

## Responsible or Coordinated Disclosure

- Details provided to vendor
- Published once a fix has been made available or a specified time limit (90 days?) has passed
- Consider delay in publishing to allow time to patch
- Generally appropriate for open source projects and published software

## Full Disclosure

- Full details of vulnerability published online
- Generally only used with unresponsive vendors or after a timeline has expired
